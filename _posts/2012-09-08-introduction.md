Great I got this blog up and running. Thank you [github](http://github.com). And now? You probably expect
me to write some exciting stuff about code and the next big thing in programming. Sorry not today. 

First this is just an *introduction* and second I've got nothing that great to share right know. But I'll let
you know if I find something. So I guess I should write something about me. Nah you probably don't care so 
I let that slide. Maybe something about this blog. Well there is a [page]({{BASE_PATH}}/about.html) for that so
I don't need to write about that. 
Yeah now my time is up and I will continue to do something productive -- writing my diploma thesis on 
[the skorokhod embedding problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skorokhod's_embedding_theorem) and 
[double barrier options](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublebarrieroption.asp#axzz25sw1lQUf). 

Have a great day and leave comments if you like -- or not.
