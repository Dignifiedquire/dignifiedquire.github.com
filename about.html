  <b>q: Why is there so little content?</b> </br>
  q: Because. This blog just started and I do have some other stuff to do besides writing a blog.
</p>
<p>
  <b>q: Where does the name dignified.code originate?</b> </br>

  blog is about programming.

<p>
  <b>q: Why are there spelling errors?</b> </br>
  a: Because. Some are because I like it better and some are because I'm no native speaker and some are 
  just for you so you have something to point out and feel good about yourself.

  <b>q: My question wasn't answered. What now?</b> </br>
  a: Your question probably isn't that great if it isn't answered here. But if you must you can email me at 
  dignifiedquire at gmail.
</p>
<p>
  <b>q: Where is your disclaimer?</b> </br>
  a: Right here. I write for fun and everything I write is information I provide "as is". So I 
  won't be responsible if you link, tell or do some other crazy sharing with this information. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>q: I don't like ____?</b> </br>
  a: You can do two things. First write a comment about ____, but please be nice. Second, no one forces
  you to read this blog, so you always have the chance to just leave. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>q: What should I do now?</b> </br>
  a: How should I know?
